<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Printer Head Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Thermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The inkjet printer head market is primarily categorized into two types: piezoelectric and thermal. Piezoelectric print heads utilize piezoelectric crystals to push ink through nozzles, allowing for precise control over droplet size and placement. This results in high-quality prints and is often used in industrial applications. In contrast, thermal print heads heat the ink to create vapor bubbles, forcing the ink out. This type is commonly found in consumer printers due to its lower cost and simpler design.</p></p>
