<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desiccants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Absorption</li><li>Chemical Absorption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desiccants market is categorized into physical absorption and chemical absorption types. Physical absorption desiccants, like silica gel and activated alumina, work by trapping moisture within their porous structures without altering their chemical composition. They are reusable and ideal for moderate humidity control. Chemical absorption desiccants, such as calcium chloride and molecular sieves, react with moisture to form new compounds, offering high efficiency in extreme conditions. Both types are widely used in industries like pharmaceuticals, food packaging, and electronics for moisture control.</p></p>
